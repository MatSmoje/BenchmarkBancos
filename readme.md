# Benchmark Bancos
This challenge is supposed to gather data from the [CMF Chile](https://www.cmfchile.cl/portal/estadisticas/617/w3-propertyvalue-28917.html). In this case the data is going to be downloaded by hand, avoiding use webscraping, because I do not know about any law that could deny it.  
After gathering all the data, I am going to show it using different kind of chart.
